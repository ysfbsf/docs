## Overview

This guide outlines the steps required to integrate Missena Native with FLEDGE through Prebid.js. It provides a comprehensive approach for enabling FLEDGE in Google Ad Manager (GAM) and configuring Prebid.js to support Missena Native as a bidder in FLEDGE auctions.

## Requirements

Before proceeding with the integration, ensure you have the following:

- FLEDGE module integrated with Prebid.js
- FLEDGE enabled within Google Ad Manager

## Integration Guide

Follow these steps to integrate Missena Native with FLEDGE:

### 1. Declare Missena Native as an Alias

Start by declaring Missena Native as an alias of Criteo within the Prebid.js configuration. This step involves specifying the Global Vendor List ID (gvlid) for Missena Native:

```javascript
pbjs.aliasBidder("criteo", "missenanative", { gvlid: 91 });
```

### 2. Configure FLEDGE Participation

Include Missena Native in the list of bidders allowed to participate in FLEDGE auctions. This configuration also enables FLEDGE and sets a default value for slot configuration:

```javascript
pbjs.setBidderConfig({
  bidders: ["openx", "criteo", "missenanative"],
  config: {
    fledgeEnabled: true,
    defaultForSlots: 1,
  },
});
```

<Note>
  Ensure that "missenanative" is included in the `bidders` array to allow Missena Native to participate in FLEDGE auctions.
</Note>

## Additional Considerations

- Make sure that FLEDGE is properly enabled and configured in your Google Ad Manager account.
- Test the integration thoroughly to ensure that Missena Native is participating correctly in FLEDGE auctions.
- Monitor performance and adjust configurations as needed for optimal results.
